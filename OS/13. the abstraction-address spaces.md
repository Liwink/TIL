## The Abstraction: Address Spaces


### Early System

* one running program (a process)
* not provide much of an abstraction of memory

### Multiprogramming and Time Sharing

* Multiprogramming increased the utilization of CPU.
* Time Sharing improved the interaction.

-> process switching 
-> multiple processes resource in memory 
-> sharing and isolation

### The Address Space

The address space of a process contains all of the memory state of the running program, such as:

1. the **code** of program
2. **stack** to keep track of where it is in the function call chain as well as to allocate local variables
3. **heap** used for dynamically-allocated, user-managed memory, such as `malloc()` in C or `new` in an object-oriented language.
4. ...

**Code** is *static* and thus easy to place in memory. **Heap** and **stack** may grow or shrink.

> How can the OS build this abstraction of a **private**（isolated）, **potentially large** address space for **multiple** running processes (all sharing memory) on top of a single, physical memory.

### Goals

1. transparency: a transparent system is one that is hard to notice
2. efficiency
3. protection and isolation

eploration:

* **mechanisms**: to virtualize memory, including hardware and operation systems support
* **policies**: manage free space, which pages to kick out of memory


##### ASIDE: every address you see is virtual
