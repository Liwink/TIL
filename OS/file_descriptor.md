## File descriptor

A file descriptor is an abstract **indicator** used to access a file or other input/output resource, such as a pipe or network socket.
A file descriptor is a non-negative integer.
Each Unix process should expect to have three POSIX file descriptors, corresponding to the three standard streams.
