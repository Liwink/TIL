## Concurrency: An Intro

##### Thread, Process

* In the thread context switch, the address space remains the same
* One stack per thread: **thread-local** storage



##### Key Concurrency Terms

* A **critical section** is a piece of code that accesses a *shared* resource, usually a variable or data structure.
* A **race condition** arises if multiple threads of execution enter the **critical section** at roughly the same time; both attempt to update the shared data structure.
* An **indeterminate** program consists of one or more **race conditions**
* To avoid these problems, threads should use some kind of **mutual exclusion** primitive.
