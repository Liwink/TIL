## Processor Register

[Processor register](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_register)

> A **processor register** is a **small amount of storage** availble as part of a digital processor, such as a central processing unit(CPU).
> Such **registers** are typlically addressed by mechanism **other than** main **memory** and can be accessed **faster**. 
> Almost all computers, load-store architecture or not, load data from a **larger** memory intp registers where it is used for **arithmetic, manipulated or tested by machine instructions**. 
> Manipulated data is then often stored back into main memory, either by the same instruction or subsequent one. Modern processors use either **static or dynamic RAM** as main memory, with the latter usually accessed via one or more cache levels.
