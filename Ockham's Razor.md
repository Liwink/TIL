## Ockham's Razor

> Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.

In science, Occam's razor is used as a *heuristic technique*(discovery tool ).

The preference for simplisity in the scientific method is based on the *falsifiability criterion*.

Each explanation can always burden failing explanations with *ad hoc hypotheses* to prevent them from being falsified.

> **Heuristic**: A **heuristic technique**, often called simply a **heuristic**, is any approach to problem solving, learning, or discovery that employs a **practical method** *not guaranteed to be optimal or perfect*, but **sufficient** for the immediate goals.
>
> Where finding an optimal solution is impossible or impractical, heuristic methods can be used to **speed up** the process of finding a **satisfactory** solution. Heuristics can be mental **shortcuts** that ease the cognitive load of making a decision.


> **Falsifiability** or **refutability** of a statement, hypothesis, or theory is the inherent possibility that it can be proven false.


> In science and philosophy, and ***ad hoc* hypothesis** is a hypothesis added to a theory in order to save if from being falsified.



#### Examples

Example: Two trees have fallen down during a windy night. Think about these two possible explanations:

1. The wind has blown them down.
2. Two meteorites have each taken one tree down, and after that hit each other and removed any trace of themselves.
