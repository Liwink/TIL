## Ping

### Background

The printer and my Mac connected in the same WiFi network. The Mac detected the printer but showed printer is not connected. 

So I tried to print, but failed.

Then I pinged the printer's static IP and it connected!

The question come: what is the difference between ping and normal connection.
